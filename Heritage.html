Sprawling across an area of 55 acres, it houses the memorial of the great leader of Andhra Pradesh, Late N T Rama Rao.

        <p align="center">
            Situated just 2km away from the heart of the city, Hussain Sagar is one of the most popular tourist places in Hyderabad. The lake connects two parts of the city (Secunderabad and Hyderabad) to each other. The largest artificial lake in Asia, Hussain Sagar lake was excavated in 1562 AD during the reign of Ibrahim Quli Qutub Shah. Built on the tributary of River Musi, the lake has been named after Hussain Shah Wali. Hussain Sagar Lake was initially built to cater to the irrigation needs and other water needs of the city. Until the year of 1930, it was used for the same purpose.

            Having been bordered by Indira Park in the east, Sanjeevaiah Park in the north, and Lumbini Park in the south, the lake presents a setting quite rare to find in the middle of any city. There is also a bund on its banks, which was built to control the flow of water. This artificial lake now beautifies the city gracefully. Not just for beauty, it is also known for its historical connection. On the banks of this Hussain Sagar Lake the treaty between Mughals and Golconda was signed.
